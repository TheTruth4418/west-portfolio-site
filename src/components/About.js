            <p>Hi! My name is William West and I am a Texas based programmer who specializes in Single Page Applications!
            I am a graduate of Flatiron School's Software Engineering program currently looking for Frontend/Fullstack roles!
            Programming has been a big part of me since high school because of my role on the robotics team as the head programmer, and since then I knew coding would become my career!</p>
